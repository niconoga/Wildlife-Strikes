        <h1>Did COVID Limit Wildlife Strikes During Air Travel?</h1>
        <h5>Wildlife strikes, otherwise widely considered as bird strikes, are common because of air travel. Research shows that the decrease on the hurtful impact of wildlife was relevant during the thick of COVID.</h5>

      <p>Although the COVID pandemic had a multitude of negative effects, one positive impact on the environment was the reduced number of wildlife strikes due to the significant decline in air travel.</p>

      <p>With the rise in air travel coming out of COVID, both bird and overall wildlife population have taken a hit. According to Statista, the number of flights decreased by 70% in 2021 because of the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels. This reduction in flights led to fewer wildlife collisions, one of the few environmental benefits of the pandemic.</p>

      <p>Data also suggests that the limited number of airstrikes during the pandemic was largely because of a lack of airplanes flying in the sky. This significant drop gave wildlife, especially birds, more space to live and go about daily activities without the constant threat or noise of aircraft in the vicinity.</p>

     <p>Wildlife, especially many species of flying birds, is affected by airplanes during various stages of flight, including taxi, takeoff, en route, approach, and landing. Birds and other species are vulnerable when aircraft operate within their habitat, leading to wildlife strikes.</p>

     <p>A wildlife strike is a collision between an aircraft and an animal, such as a bird, mammal, bat, or reptile.</p>

     <p class = "body">
      <a href= "https://skybrary.aero/articles/wildlife-strike#:~:text=Wildlife%20strikes%20may%20occur%20during,aircraft%20while%20on%20the%20ground.">According to SKYbrary</a>, “wildlife strikes may occur during any phase of flight but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach, and landing phases. The reason is that most birds fly at lower levels and other animals can only hit an aircraft while on the ground."</p>

      <p class = "body">
      Although birds are the most commonly struck type of wildlife, there are other animals that have been factored into the equation nowadays.

      <p class = "body">
      SKYbrary notes that “the term to describe such events was initially bird strike since this was the most common scenario. However, the increased number of flights and airfields used resulted, among other things, in the increase of collisions between aircraft and animals other than birds.”</p>

      <p class = "body">
      The most common phase of flight in which wildlife strikes occur is the approach. An approach is when the airplane starts its descent from cruising altitude. Other main phases of impact include the landing roll, which is right when the airplane is about to make impact on the ground, along with the take-off run as the plane accelerates on the runway for departure, and finally during the climb phase as the airplane is ascending into the air. </p>

      <iframe title="Which Phase Of Flight Induces The Most Wildlife Strikes?" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-TCzFt" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TCzFt/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="373" data-external="1"></iframe>

      <p class = "body">
      Jim Cable, a retired American Airlines pilot, believes that the large majority of wildlife strikes are still birds. He points out that there is a lot of fencing on the ground around airport runways to limit wildlife from entering the runway.</p>

      <p class = "body">
      “Most of the strikes are during approach or takeoff, because they’re both closer to the ground, and the plane is at a slower speed compared to high altitude,” said Cable. “Sometimes you look out of the corner of the eye looking at instruments, and you call out ‘bird.’ Right then, you have to look out to hear something and you hope there’s not an engine air intake.”</p>

      <p class = "body">
      Cable also mentioned that “wildlife strikes have definitely been an issue. In the movie “Sully,” two birds ran into engines and the plane lost both of them and landed in the Hudson.”</p>

      <p class = "body">
      The <a href= "https://www.sullenbergeraviation.org/the-miracle-on-the-hudson-event-changed-lives-and-created-lifelong-bonds/"> "Miracle on the Hudson"</a> is one of the most well-known events in the history of air travel when a flock of Canada geese flew into the engines of US Airways Flight 1549, which caused the plane to lose power. Captain Chesley Sullenberger landed the plane safely in the Hudson River, and all 155 people on board stayed alive.</p>

      <p class = "body">
      On the other hand, <a href= "https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2017/10/05/bird-strike-boston-plane-crash/">the deadliest bird strike in U.S history</a> occurred in 1960 when a flock of starling birds struck the engines of Eastern Airlines Flight 375 just after takeoff from Boston Logan International Airport. This incident killed 62 people and injured 10 others.</p>

      <p class = "body">
      Cable noted that anytime there is a wildlife strike, “the FAA requires you to fill out a form and submit.” While he didn’t have much experience with analyzing wildlife strikes during COVID, he “assumes there was a decline.”</p>

      <p class = "body">
      Overall, there was an “anthropause” among humans during the pandemic, a period where human activity slowed down dramatically, leading to unexpected benefits for birds and other wildlife.</p>

      <p class = "body">
      According to <a href= "https://www.audubon.org/news/a-year-pandemic-how-have-birds-and-other-wildlife-responded">Audubon</a>, “thanks to drastically reduced air travel, birds appeared in greater numbers around airports last year than in the past. In addition to exploring and exploiting new habitats, wildlife benefited from fewer cars—roadkill mortality dropped in many U.S. states—and less pollution.”</p>

      <p class = "body">
      Life certainly changed during the pandemic, and for wildlife, particularly birds, one of the few positive outcomes was the reduction in air travel and wildlife strikes. This temporary relief for wildlife may have given some endangered species, whether in the air or on the ground, some much-needed air and room to breathe from human efforts.</p>
