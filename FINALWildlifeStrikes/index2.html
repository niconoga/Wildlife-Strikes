      With the rise in air travel coming out of COVID, it also impacts the bird and overall wildlife population. The number of flights decreased during the year 2021 by 70% because of the pandemic, according to Statista. This also equated to less birds and other wildlife populations getting hit, which was one of the few positives coming out of the pandemic. I found in my research, interview, and data that the approach phase of the flight route still affects the most birds, which is still the primary species when it comes to strikes. Finally, data also suggests that COVID limited the number of airstrikes because of a lack of airplanes flying in the air.”</p>

      Wildlife, especially many species of flying birds, is affected by airplanes while in the air, whether it’s during taxi, takeoff, en route, approach, or landing. There are many different ways that birds and other species are affected when it comes to airplanes taking up their habitat. All of this combined leads to wildlife strikes. A wildlife strike is a collision between an aircraft and an animal, such as a bird, mammal, bat, or reptile. <a href= "https://skybrary.aero/articles/wildlife-strike#:~:text=Wildlife%20strikes%20may%20occur%20during,aircraft%20while%20on%20the%20ground.">According to SKYbrary</a>, “wildlife strikes may occur during any phase of flight but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach, and landing phases. The reason is that most birds fly at lower levels and other animals can only hit an aircraft while on the ground.</p>

      Although it might seem that birds are the most common type of wildlife struck, there are other animals that have been factored into the equation nowadays. SKYbrary also notes that “the term to describe such events was initially bird strike since this was the most common scenario. However, the increased number of flights and airfields used resulted, among other things, in the increase of collisions between aircraft and animals other than birds.” Jim Cable, a retired American Airlines pilot, still believes that a large majority of wildlife strikes are still birds and says that there is a lot of fencing on the ground around airport runways to limit wildlife from entering the runway.</p>

      One of my childhood friends’ stepdad is a retired American pilot, and he connected me with one of his friends and former American colleagues. This interview was conducted via phone call.</p>

      Cable said that “wildlife strikes have definitely been an issue. In the movie “Sully,” two birds ran into engines and the plane lost both of them and landed in the Hudson.” He said that most of the strikes are during approach or takeoff, because they’re both closer to the ground, and the plane is at a slower speed compared to high altitude. “Sometimes you look out of the corner of the eye looking at instruments, and you call out “bird.” Right then, you have to look out to hear something and you hope there’s not an engine air intake. Cable said that anytime there is a wildlife strike, the FAA requires you to fill out a form and submit. Finally, he mentioned that still nearly all of the wildlife strikes are in the form of birds. Based on this interview and with the data I’ve found, it’s safe to assume that most of the wildlife strikes are birds. Cable didn’t have much experience with looking at wildlife strikes during COVID, but he “assumes there was a decline.”</p>

      **going to add to the impact of the collisions here... and more instances adding to the movie example.**</p>
